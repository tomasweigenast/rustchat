## Communication Protocol
Peers connect to the server, which acts as a relay redirecting messages to the users. This allows a little bit of security
because users won't known the IP address of their peers. 

### Packet Format
The size of the packet is not restricted when using TCP as connection. A TCP packet looks like this:
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|               1               |               2               |               3               |               4               |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
